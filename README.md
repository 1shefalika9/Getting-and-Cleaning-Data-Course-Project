# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
contains the required scripts and code book for the project.

This repository is the submission of **Shefalika Ghosh** for the final course project of **'Getting and Cleaning Data** of the Data Science Specialization course authorized by Johns Hopkins University and offered through Coursera. This file contains instructions on how to run analysis on the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset'

## Dataset
[link to Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Files in the repository
1. CodeBook.md - code book containing information on all data, variables and transformations done to perform the project and produce the final tidy data set.

2. run_analysis.R - R script containing R code that performs the following on the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' dataset:
  i. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  ii.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  iii.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  iv.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  v. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each         variable for each activity and each subject.
  
3. tidy_data.txt - the final tidy data set obtained after going through the five steps above
